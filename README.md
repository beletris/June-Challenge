# June Challenge
## General info
Based on "Pokaż stronę światu" ("Show the page to the world") front-end challenge on https://bedeprogramistka.pl. I have made some modifications in my version of the excercise - original site is about cupcakes not coffee, there is different color palette et caetera.

## Technologies
The whole project includes index.html site only. The scope of the challenge was very basic, that is why RWD here is poor. Besides HTML and CSS, also jQuery has been used for the slider.
