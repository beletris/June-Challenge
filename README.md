Based on "Pokaż stronę światu" ("Show the page to the world") front-end challenge. I've made some modifications in this version of the excersise (original site is about cupcakes not coffee, there is different color palette etc - because why not). The whole project includes index.html only and is very basic hence yes, RWD here is kinda poor.
